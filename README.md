# OilyGiant Mining Company: Well Location Analysis

**Project Goal:**  
To determine the best location for a new oil well to maximize profit.

---

## Steps to Choose the Location
1. Collect the oil well parameters in the selected regions (oil quality and volume of reserves).  
2. Build a model for predicting the volume of reserves in new wells.  
3. Select the oil wells with the highest estimated values.  
4. Pick the region with the highest total profit for the selected wells.  

---

## Analysis Approach
- Build and train a predictive model to estimate reserves.  
- Evaluate potential profit in each region.  
- Assess risks and uncertainty using the **Bootstrapping technique**.  

---

## Expected Outcome
Identify the region with the **highest profit margin** and **lowest risk** for drilling new wells.
